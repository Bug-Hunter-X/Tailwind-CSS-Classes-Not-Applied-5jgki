# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly.  The expected styling (red background and padding) is not rendered.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simple example demonstrating the issue. The `div` element should have a red background and padding, but this is not the case. This is likely due to an error in the Tailwind CSS configuration,  a conflict with other CSS, or an issue with how the Tailwind directives are being used in the project.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a potential solution. It could be as simple as ensuring the Tailwind CSS directives are correctly included in the project, checking for CSS conflicts, or fixing an issue with how the class is named or applied.  It might also involve ensuring that the correct build process is in place for Tailwind CSS.
